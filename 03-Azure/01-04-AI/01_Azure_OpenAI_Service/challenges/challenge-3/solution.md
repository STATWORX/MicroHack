## Prerequisites

In order to complete Challenge 3, make sure that you have successfully completed Challenge 1 and 2, meaning that you should have a running Chroma Database as well as a functioning Azure Function.

## Task 1: Setup Streamlit App

**Resources:**\
[Streamlit documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/)\
[OpenAI API Completions Endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions)\
[OpenAI Text Completion Guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/completion)

In this Challenge, we will use Streamlit to build a very simple web-based UI where users are able to upload new documents to our blob storage as well as interface with the Q&A system we have built so far.

Streamlit is a Python library that allows you to create interactive web applications and dashboards for machine learning and data science projects, without requiring expertise in web development. It is an open-source tool that provides a simple and intuitive way to build and share data-driven applications.

With Streamlit, you can quickly prototype and build interactive data applications using familiar Python syntax. The library provides a set of easy-to-use widgets for creating user interfaces, including sliders, dropdowns, text inputs, and more.

Setting up a Streamlit app in Python is a straightforward process. All you need is to install Streamlit in your Python environment, create a Python script where you will define the look and functionality of your UI and run the app via a simple terminal command.

First, add the Streamlit package to the ```environment.txt``` file we used in Challenge 2 and run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` once again.

Now, we can already start working on our UI. Create a Python file ```main.py```, import Streamlit and add your first widget:

```Python
import streamlit as st

# Add a title to your app
st.title("My Streamlit App")
```


Running the app is as easy as executing the following code in your terminal:

```console
streamlit run main.py
```

This command will print out some information in the terminal, most importantly, the link to your app. By default, Streamlit apps which are locally run are found under http://localhost:8501.

If you follow this link, the Streamlit app should open up in your default browser:

## Task 2: Create Streamlit Widgets

**Resources:**

Next, we will start designing the needed widgets. More specifically, our app should feature

- an upload widget where users can upload files to the blob storage we created in Challenge 1
- a text box where users can ask their questions which will then be used to retrieve relevant paragraphs from the Chroma DB. The retrieved information, together with the user query, is then fed into the Completions endpoint of the Azure OpenAI Service
- a slider where the number of paragraphs to retrieve from Chroma can be selected
- a section where the generated answer is displayed
- a section where the retrieved information from the Chroma DB is displayed

This sounds more complicated than it actually is. To create the widgets, add the following code to your ```main.py```:

```Python
import streamlit as st

# App title
st.title("Microhack: Semantic Q&A-Bot")

# File upload in sidebar
doc = st.sidebar.file_uploader(
    ":page_facing_up: Upload your own documents to the knowledge base here"
)

# Query free-text window with default question
st.markdown("### :question: Query the bot here:")
query = st.text_input("query", value="Who are statworx?", label_visibility="collapsed")

# Paragraph slider (default of 3)
n_paragraphs = st.slider(
    "Number of paragraphs to retrieve and source answer from:",
    min_value=1,
    max_value=5,
    value=3,
)

# Display answer
st.markdown("### :robot_face: The Q&A-bot answers:")
st.write("Answer will be displayed here!")

# Display paragraphs
st.markdown(f"### :bulb: This answer was sourced from {n_paragraphs} paragraphs:")
st.write("Retrieved paragraphs will be displayed here!")
```

When reloading the web page, the app should now look like this:
